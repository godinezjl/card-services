### Installing on Mac
To get started, lets begin by setting up the python3 environment. By default, MacOS ships with Python2. We should not uninstall it as many programs rely on that version.

#### Open terminal and type the following command

```
brew install python3
```
#### Check for Python 3 Version
To check the proper version was installed, type the following command and ensure the output is Python 3.x.x, where x stands for some version of the Python 3 release.

```
python3 --version
Python 3.7.4

```

#### Install PIP Package Management System
Now that python is installed, we need to install the PIP package management system. In your terminal type the following command.
```
sudo easy_install pip
```

#### Install VirtualEnv for Python
Now, let's install the VirtualEnv to allow us to run multiple version of python3 in our system.
```
sudo pip install virtualenv
```


End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
